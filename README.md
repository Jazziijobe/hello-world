# hello-world
Just joined Github

I have an interest in web design and development. I have a certificate in web design I completed some time ago and have used exteral hard drives to store code on. I was told to get myself onto GitHub to share some of my hobby online and have a better place to keep my code. I have now joined another course on EDX to get myself back in the swing of things and enjoy coding in my spare time again.
